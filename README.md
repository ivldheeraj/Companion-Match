## 📦 Prerequisites

Before you can run the app, make sure you have the following installed:

### ✅ Node.js & npm

React apps use **Node.js** and **npm** (Node Package Manager). You can check if they are installed by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

## 📁 Cloning the Project

If this project is hosted on GitHub or another Git service, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

📥 Install Dependencies
Inside the project folder, run:

```bash
npm install
```
This will download all required packages listed in the package.json file.


▶️ Running the Application
Once dependencies are installed, start the app using:

```bash
npm start
```

This will:

Build the app

Launch a local development server

Automatically open the app in your default browser
